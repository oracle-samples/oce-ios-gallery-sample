# About iOS Image Gallery Sample

This repository holds the sample source code for an iOS image gallery app showing images from Oracle Content Management.

Please see the complete [tutorial](https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=cloud&id=oce-ios-gallery-sample).

## Installation

Source code may be obtained from Github:

```
git clone https://github.com/oracle-samples/oce-ios-gallery-sample
```

## Running the project

Open the project file, `GalleryDemo.xcodeproj`.

Open the file, `credentials.json` and provide information about your Oracle Content Management instance:

```json 
{
    "url": "https://headless.mycontentdemo.com",
    "channelToken": "e0b6421e73454818948de7b1eaddb091"
}
```

- `url` - the full URL (and optional port) for your Content Management instance
- `channelToken` - the token associated with the channel to which your assets were published

Once you have provided the necessary credential information, select an appropriate iOS target and click the Run button.

This sample may be run on-device or in a simulator. The functionality will be identical in both.
